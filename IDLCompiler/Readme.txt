This compiler creates CLS modules out of idl-files

usage:

arg1: target assembly name
arg2 - argN: idl-Files to map

because generated modules can't be changed after the generation, specify all important idl-files (e.g all Home/Remote-interfaces of java-beans) on the command line for one run. The dependant idl-files
are automatically considered.

The result of a compiler run is a multi module assembly, referencing the generated CLS-modules for all mapped IDL-modules.



INFO:
The parser is generated by a modified version of JavaCC generating C# code instead of java code.
